# Dictionaries are collection of an items.

"""Each item in the Dictionary is in key value pair just like a map.
Whenever we provide any value, make sure that we associate with a key."""

# It is dynamic in nature. It means we can have n number of Key-Value pairs here.

"""It is Unordered like a set. 
We don't have an index feature here, hence whenever we want to get any specific value,
we need to provide the key then we get the value."""

# Using Dictionaries, we can fetch the values with a key.
# Keys in Dictionaries should be unique, but values can be duplicate.


# Syntax1:
# {key1:value1, key2:value2}
# Example1: {1:"Python", 2:"Selenium"} Integer as a key and value as a string.
# Example2: {"Pyselium":"Testing Team", "PyDev":"Dev Team"} # Both key and values are string.
# There is no type restriction.

# Syntax2 using dict() constructor. The dict is separate class.
# myDict=dict("Pyselium":"Testing Team", "PyDev":"Dev Team")


# Syntax3:(Development Project)
# myDict = dict([("Pyselium", "Testing Team"), ("PyDev", "Dev Team")])
