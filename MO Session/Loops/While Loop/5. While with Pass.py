x = 0
while x < 5:
    #print("Hello")
    pass
# Due to some reasons if I want to comment the while, we will get syntax error which is called indent expected.
# In this condition, to avoid, we use a pass statement.
'''Consider the scenario if I need to write while loop, but for the time being I need it to be empty
(Ignore for time being) then want to continue, then it is possible from pass.'''
# The moment when we say pass, the error disappears.
# Pass statement simply does nothing.
# Can I use a pass statement to write an empty loop? Yes.
# Can I use a pass statement with any other control statement?
# Yes, we can pass with "for", "functions" and "classes".
