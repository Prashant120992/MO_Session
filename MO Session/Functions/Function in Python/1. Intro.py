# The function is a block of code or set of statement that will perform a set of activity/task.
"""Let's say if we have 100 lines of code, then if we want to divide those into blocks, then we can say a block of code
is function."""
# Functions will be having a proper name. In programming, it says exactly what this code block is doing exactly.
# Example : calculateEMI(), checkResult(), getValueFromExcel()

# The function will increase modularity. Here we are creating as many as functions & we will call them whenever needed.
# The function will increase reusability. We can reuse the block of code again and again by using function.
'''The readability is more. Lets say if we write 1000 of lines, it is difficult to read those lines but when we talk 
about function, it is very easy to read and understand'''

# We can parameterize the function. The moment when we make parameterizing, we will make these functions as dynamic.
# Based on the parameter function will behave.
# The Function will return values by using return keyword.
